Cucumber ::


when you are using Examples: in the feature file  then we neede to write the Scenario Outline:

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
runwith - to excute .feature files as Junit tests
Cucumber.class - to reading feature file and connect with step defintions

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features", // Path to your feature files
    glue = "com.example.stepdefinitions", // Package containing step definition classes
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports"}, // Reporting options
    tags = "@SmokeTest" // Tags to filter which tests to run
)



RunWith(Cucumber.class): This tells JUnit to use the Cucumber class to run the tests.
@CucumberOptions: This is used to specify various options for running the Cucumber tests, such as:
features: Path to the directory containing feature files.
glue: Package where step definition classes are located.
plugin: Reporting options to generate test reports.
tags: Filter to run specific tests based on tags.
